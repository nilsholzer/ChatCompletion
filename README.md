# ChatCompletion
This is a little automatic Chat Completion using the OpenAI API :)

Please check if you have installed Python and all the other packages, before trying to run the application

All the necessary packages are listed in the requirements.txt file

Install all the packages in the file via:

    pip install -r .\requirements.txt

Also, make sure to install a virtual environment.

Because Git realises when an OPEN AI API key is published to the repository, and therefore prevents this, and because it would be unsafe, I haven't included an OPEN AI API key to the repository.

If you want to use the Chat Completion you need to create a file called "API_KEY" in which only the API key is stored. A method then will read the file and extract the code. The file must be created in the same directory as the app.py and README file.
